# Rify's C Game Frame Work
Rify's C Game Frame Work (RCGFW) has been developed by Jacob Thomas as a personal project for a future game idea.

The framework will support texture loading, shader loading, gl wrapping, rudimentary entity component system, audio loading, and much more.

RCGFW is still under development and this is the fifth rewrite since initial development started.

The to-do list for the project can be found via `TODO.md` and the TODO list covers all things that have been implemented and features that have yet to be implemented and even ideas for the framework (denoted with '?').

----

RCGFW is entirely written in ISO C99. The following libraries were used to compile this project:
* GLFW - Window & Context Creation
* OpenGL - Rendering
* CGLM - Math Library
* GLAD - OpenGL Extension Loader
* StbImage - Image Loading
